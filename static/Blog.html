                <p>Study advice:
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;-Get a good nights sleep for several nights before doing your studying (8 hours at least!). 😴
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;-Eliminate any distractions by using our           app to block social media use and turning off the TV. It has been said that “work accomplished= intensity of focus x time spent”. Therefore it is far more effective to work for shorter periods at a higher intensity. This also means you have more time to spend relaxing. 😎
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Mix up your study environment, for example try going to the library or a coffee shop. Also attempt to keep your working environment organised.☕️
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Listen to some calming music while studying such as classical (avoid any musics with lyrics). 🎶
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Eat foods that will give you sustainable energy (such as nuts) rather than just sugary treats that will result in a blood sugar crash! 🍬
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Take regular breaks every 45 minutes, for example going for a 20 minute brisk walk.🌞
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Exercise before you study. Exercise releases endorphins which improve mood and reduce stress levels.🏃🏿‍♀️
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Take time to relax! If you become too tired you will become less efficient and spend more time studying and become more tired. It is vital to break this viscous cycle. 🤯
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Don’t set unrealistic study expectations- you are only human! If you aim to do too much and don’t meet your expectations you will be disappointed and disheartened.😎
</div><div>
</div><div>Ideas of study methods:
</div><div>The most important thing is to work continuously throughout the year, revising what you did that day every night- this will help you to avoid a last minute cram which can be very stressful and ineffective! The way you study might be completely  different from your friends and that’s totally normal. Don’t give up and experiment with lots of different techniques too see what works best for YOU not everyone else.
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	If you are a visual learner you may find mind mapping is perfect. All you have to do is write your topic in the centre.  Right the main ideas around the page and connect them to the centre with a line. Next expand upon each of those ideas with sub-branches. Your page should end up very messy but that’s exactly what you want! 🗺
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Use lots of colour in your notes! Remember it’s vital you don’t colour everything, just the important bits. Right down any key points in red and highlight information in yellow. Underlining in different ways can also be very helpful, for example you may choose to straight underline a key point and squiggly underline a fact you find interesting. Just get creative! 〰
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Decorate your notes with lots of little diagrams and doodles to aid your learning. Diagrams are a method of expressing a lot of information very quickly.🎨
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	If you are studying a science we have found the best way to achieve top grades is to do as many questions as possible! For example the SQA website has past exam papers for the last 4 years on their website. TOP TIP: remember to look up the specimen papers too! ⁉️
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	The Leitner system is a studying technique to optimise your use of flash cards. To do this you will need three boxes. Start with all the cards in box 1. If you get an answer correct move the card to box 2, if it is wrong keep the card in box 1. Repeat until you have gone through all your cards. The next day redo the cards. If u get an answer correct move it up a box, if you get it wrong move it down a box. Repeat going over the cards in boxes 1 and 2 until all the cards are in box 3.♠️
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Before you review an area of study think of questions that you should know the answer too by the time you have finished your study to help focus your learning. You could also make notes in the form of question and answer. 😎
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Focus on an area of study for a short time for a period over several days, rather than try to cramming it in on one occasion. 🙂
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Record yourself explaining the topic, without looking at notes.🙈
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Write one/two word bullet points of what was covered on each page. When you come back to revise rather than automatically reading the whole page, consider if you are already conformable with that point. This will allow you to spend more time on what you do not feel comfortable with. 🤗
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	At exam time try to mix up your day- do not spend the whole day revising the same subject as this can be very boring. 💃
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Make use of revision websites such as Scholar and BBC Bitesize, which offer a condense summary covering the key points as well as revision questions. 🤓
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Set timers for how long you are going to spend on each topic. Studying will always expand to fill the time you give it without you necessarily having achieved any more.⏳
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Ask questions if you don’t understand! Teachers are here to help you! ☺️
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	If you get a question wrong in a test make a note of the question and the correct answer so you don’t make the same mistake again. Remember mistakes are always an opportunity for learning.✅
</div><div>&nbsp;⁃	Make a tick list of what you want to study every day. Meeting your goals can provide you with a real sense of accomplishment! 😁
