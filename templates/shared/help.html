            Registering Pupils
        </h3>
        <h4>Pupil Credits</h4>
        <p>
            In order to register pupils you need <b>Pupil Credits</b>. Each pupil credit will allow you to create a pupil account. 
            To get pupil credits, contact the Senior Duke administration team. You will then be required to pay for the number of pupil credits required.
            To check how many pupil credits your school has, click on the <b>Pupils</b> tab and to the right of the search bar in the middle, you will see a small bubble with the number of pupil credits displayed.
        </p>
        <h4>Create a Pupil Account</h4>
        <p>
           If your school has pupil credits remaining, you can create a pupil account by navigating to the <b>Pupils</b> tab then clicking the <i>Add Pupil</i> button next to the search bar in the middle.
           Fill in the details for the pupil, ensuring that the email is correct. 
           Make sure to select the correct award (Gold or Silver) from the award drop down box, then click <i>Add Pupil</i> at the bottom.
           Once this is done, the pupil will be emailed with an auto-generated password to allow them to log in and start completing their award.
           You can quickly create another pupil account by following the prompt on the screen.
        </p>
        <h4>Viewing a Pupil Account/Password</h4>
        <p>
           Once a pupil is registered, you may view their account by navigating to the <b>Pupils</b> tab then clicking on the <b>email address</b> of the pupil from the list of pupils.
           Here you can see various details about the pupil.
           If the pupil has not changed their password, you will be able to see their auto-generated password here as well. 
           However if they have changed it, you should use the password reset feature to gain access to the account, if they have forgotten their password.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Registering Teachers
        </h3>
        <p>
            Teacher accounts are able to view and mark pupil activities. Only school administrator accounts are allowed to create teacher accounts - other teacher accounts cannot. 
            To create a teacher account navigate to the <b>Teachers</b> tab and click on the <i>Add Teacher</i> button next to the search bar in the middle.
            Fill in the details for the teacher, ensuring the email is correct, then click <i>Add Teacher</i> at the bottom.
            Once this is done, the teacher will be emailed with an auto-generated password to allow them to log. This password can be changed by the teacher.

        <h3>
            Reviewing Sections
        </h3>
        <p>
            Once a pupil has completed a section, they should submit it for review. 
            Once this is done, the section will appear in the list of unreviewed sections in the <b>Unreviewed Sections</b> tab.
            You can review the section by clicking on the section row in the list.
            If you are happy that the section has been completed to an adequate level, click on <i>Mark as Complete</i> in the feedback section at the bottom.
            If not, provide a reason as to what to fix, then click <i>Mark as Not Approved</i> in the feedback section at the bottom.
            If you mark as complete by accident, you can click undo by scrolling back down to the bottom and clicking the <i>Undo</i> button.
            Alternatively, if you think that the pupil has gone above and beyond, you can mark the section as oustanding, which means it may be reviewed by the Senior Duke team.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can also review any pupil's progress, even if they have not marked the section as complete.
            To do this, navigate to the <b>Pupils</b> tab then click on a the pupil that you would like to view from the list of pupils.
            You will then be presented with a grid of sections, identical to what the pupil themselves see when they log in. 
            You can click on any section and review their progress, however you may not edit any part of the page.
