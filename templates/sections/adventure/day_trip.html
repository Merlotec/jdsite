Get out into the countryside. Plan a trip to either cycle or hike for the day (over
three hours) in a remote area. Before you go, make sure you take time to study a
map and make a written plan including: directions, turns at junctions, streams you
will cross etc. Have your plan as well as the map with you on your trip and know
how to read it. You should know exactly where you are in relation to your starting
point and be able to spot main features on your map like streams, hills and paths.

You must carry a suitably-packed backpack for the trip. You must be with a
trusted adult but they should not lead the trip. They should allow you to take
wrong turns but should be there to ensure you are safe. After completing your
first trip, reflect on what you did well and what you could have done better. Did
you have the right kit? Were your directions written in enough detail? Do you
need to practice map reading? Plan a second trip to a different place and make
sure you improve on all your weaker areas.

For assessment, you will need: (for trip 1 and trip 2) your written plans, flat-lay
photos of the contents of your backpack, photos of the trips and your self
assessments.
