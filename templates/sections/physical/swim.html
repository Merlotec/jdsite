Hopefully pools are open near you. How quickly can you swim 200m? Aim to swim at
least twice a week. Time yourself at your local pool. Over two months keep a diary of
your timed swims. Work hard to see how much you can improve your time and your
breathing.

As with the running challenge, keep a well-recorded diary of each of your swims
including: dates, times for 200m and emotions. Also, as with the running challenge,
create a graph showing your progress.
