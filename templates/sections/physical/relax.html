Aim to improve your flexibility through Yoga. Look for Yoga sessions online and aim to
do two sessions a week for two months. Before you begin, take evidence of how easily
(or not!) you can touch your toes whilst standing and whilst sitting and as many other
stretches you can think of. Record this information. During this time, you should also
learn to relax your mind and minimise stress by following a ‘(guided) meditation for
teenagers’ session found online. Aim to do this twice a week as well as the Yoga.
Throughout the two months, you should keep a table recording: the dates and times
you spend doing Yoga and Meditation, your emotions before/after/during, any
increase in flexibility. You must also note which Yoga and Meditation videos you
followed stating whether you found them useful or not (this record will be useful for
you and your friends when you or they next want to follow a ‘good’ video). You may
choose to follow the same videos throughout because you like them but may also find
that some are difficult or more stressful than relaxing!Your diary and ‘before and after’
evidence should be glued into this book for assessment.
