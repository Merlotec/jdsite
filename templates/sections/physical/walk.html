On average we walk three to four miles an hour. According to your level of
fitness, your aim is to decide how far you plan to walk twice a week. You could aim
to walk the same measured loop each time and will find, over the two month
period, you can complete your loop increasingly quickly. As with the running
challenge, keep an ongoing table of your walks including: dates, duration,
distances, times, emotions.
