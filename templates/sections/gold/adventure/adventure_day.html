Plan a day in the countryside. This can be biking or walking etc. and could even be a multi-sport day eg.
Cycle up a valley or to the coast, lock up your bike so that you can walk the next leg of the journey, wild
swim in a river, lake or sea (choose carefully-think of tides, currents etc. You must keep yourself safe), have
a picnic and head back for the return leg. Long before you go, look at maps like Ordinance Survey maps of
the area and plan where you will start and end your journey. A good day in the hills can take upwards of five
hours. Your journey should take that long too but doesnâ€™t have to be in the hills. You will need to learn about
map symbols so that you can tell what your surroundings should be. You will need to have a bag packed with
waterproofs, warmth, food, water, map, compass (and know how to use them!)
A trusted adult should go with you but should allow you to lead and make wrong turns. Their job is to keep
you safe.

For assessment, show a map of your adventure along with photos of the day.
