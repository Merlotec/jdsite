(This will require some camping things such as a tent. Some schools & community groups may have
things to borrow.) Camping for two nights takes a lot more organisation and care than just the one
night. You need to keep your things dry and you need to plan what you will eat and do for the two
days. You will need to carry everything with you. Plan your start point, your two camp spots (you
can camp both nights in the same place) and your end point. Discuss and agree with an adult
whether you will pitch a tent/tarpaulin at campsites or in the wild. You should do it with as little
assistance as possible. If it is a two man tent you should need NO help. You may have a sibling or
parent for company but they should not do anything for you. Before you go, read up on the
Outdoor Access Code so that you know how to look after our countryside. Sleep all night, on both
nights, in the tent and, without causing any damage to anything (grass included) cook and eat your
dinner outside too. Take photos or videos of the event. A trusted adult should not help but should
ensure that you are safe.
For assessment, you will need: your plan, photos of your camps when you were set up, photos of the
places you camped and ate to show that you left no trace, evidence of what you did on your journey
(walking, fishing, photography, doing nature art/craft etc) and a written comment from your trusted
adult describing how you got on.
