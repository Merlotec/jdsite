Plan a walking tour of your city. It should be challenging for you. Depending on
your fitness, aim for around five miles in a loop and you should aim to pass as
many places and things that show your city for the colourful, lively place it is eg:
famous buildings, bridges, parks, street art, steps etc. You should plan your route
carefully before you go by writing out the directions and street names and you
should make sure that you use a free app to ‘map your walk’ so that you can use
that as part of your evidence. It will show your distance, time and a map of your
route. Also make sure your phone battery is full as you need to take carefully-shot photos of your chosen landmarks. Once home, choose between 10 and 15
of your pictures to create a photo quiz on a programme like PowerPoint. This
should include: your route map, a photo per slide for a family Zoom Quiz/Form
Quiz or for your assessor to try to recognise. You must have the answers - eg. a
final 'answers' slide which should include your map and display smaller versions of
your photos with labels and arrows pointing to where on your route they belong.
