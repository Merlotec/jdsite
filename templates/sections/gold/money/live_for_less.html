<b>Part A.</b> Sit with your parents and discuss how much the familyâ€™s bills are. Work out what your share
of the electricity bill, gas bill, mortgage, food bill, phone bills, Netflix and subscriptions etc. Do the
maths to work out how much it costs for you to live. What do YOU spend most on? What can
YOU do without? How can you live for less? Where can cuts be made?
<br>
<b>Part B.</b> Looking ahead to when you leave home, in which area would you like to live? Look on Right
Move or other websites to find out how much it costs to rent in that area per month.
<br>
<b>Part C.</b> Write a detailed plan to show how you intend to be able to afford to live out with your
family home. Which honest jobs would you be interested in doing to make money. When will you
aim to start earning?
