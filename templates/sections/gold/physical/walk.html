On average we take 9mins to walk 1km. Your aim is to walk 5km at least twice a week. Over the two
month period, you should find it easier and quicker to walk 5km.

Twice a week for 2 MONTHS, you must keep an ongoing table of your
exercise including: dates, duration, distances, times, emotions (how you felt before/after/during -
you donâ€™t have to write much). Each time, input your times to a graph to see how you have
succeeded in improving your time and emotion. The map, table and graph is the evidence required
for assessment.
