Aim to improve your flexibility through Yoga. Look for Yoga sessions online and aim to do two
sessions a week for two months. Before you begin, take evidence of how easily (or not!) you can
touch your toes whilst standing and whilst sitting and as many other stretches you can think of.
Record this information. During this time, you should also learn to relax your mind and minimise
stress by following a ‘(guided) meditation for teenagers’ session found online. Aim to do this twice a
week as well as the Yoga. Throughout the two months, you should keep a table recording: the dates
and times you spend doing Yoga and Meditation, your emotions before/after/during, any increase in
flexibility. You must also note which Yoga and Meditation videos you followed stating whether you
found them useful or not (this record will be useful for you and your friends when you or they next
want to follow a ‘good’ video). You may choose to follow the same videos throughout because you
like them but may also find that some are difficult or more stressful than relaxing! Your diary and
‘before and after’ evidence should be included for assessment.

Twice a week for 2 MONTHS, you must keep an ongoing table of your
exercise including: dates, duration, distances, times, emotions (how you felt before/after/during -
you don’t have to write much). Each time, input your times to a graph to see how you have
succeeded in improving your time and emotion. The map, table and graph is the evidence required
for assessment.
