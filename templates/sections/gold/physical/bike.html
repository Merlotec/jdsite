If you are lucky enough to have access to a static bike, time yourself cycling 10km. Cycling 10km on
roads can be dangerous and, throughout winter, could be even more dangerous. However, if you
have a large park near you, work out how many laps of it you would need to do to complete 10km.

Twice a week for 2 MONTHS, you must keep an ongoing table of your
exercise including: dates, duration, distances, times, emotions (how you felt before/after/during -
you donâ€™t have to write much). Each time, input your times to a graph to see how you have
succeeded in improving your time and emotion. The map, table and graph is the evidence required
for assessment.
