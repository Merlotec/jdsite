How quickly can you run 5km? Choose a safe place to run a 5k or do it on
a treadmill and measure a mile. Make sure you and your parents agree that it is a
safe 'place and time' to run. Aim to run at least twice a week. Over two months
keep a record of your timed runs. Work hard to see how much you can improve
your time.
<br>
Twice a week for 2 MONTHS, you must keep an ongoing table of your
exercise including: dates, duration, distances, times, emotions (how you felt before/after/during -
you donâ€™t have to write much). Each time, input your times to a graph to see how you have
succeeded in improving your time and emotion. The map, table and graph is the evidence required
for assessment.
