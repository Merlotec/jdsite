Hopefully pools are open near you. How quickly can you swim 200m? Aim to swim at
least twice a week. Time yourself at your local pool. Over two months keep a diary of
your timed swims. Work hard to see how much you can improve your time and your
breathing.

Twice a week for 2 MONTHS, you must keep an ongoing table of your
exercise including: dates, duration, distances, times, emotions (how you felt before/after/during -
you donâ€™t have to write much). Each time, input your times to a graph to see how you have
succeeded in improving your time and emotion. The map, table and graph is the evidence required
for assessment.
