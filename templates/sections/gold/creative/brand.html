Whenever you put a comment or a photo online for others to see, you are giving information
about you as a 'brand'. When you are a little older and looking for a job, future employers will
search online to find out all about you. You need to be aware of that already and make sure
you are showing yourself in your best light.
<br>
<b>Part A:</b> Think about what your strengths are and create a CV. This should be a maximum of 2x A4,
succinct pages packed with well-organised information which shows the reader who you are and
why you would be an ideal addition to a workforce. It should include your hobbies, interests, any
history of enterprising activities, achievements, evidence of life skills and explain briefly some life
experiences which have impacted on you. You should also recognise your weaknesses and think how
you can address and improve them whilst also acquiring new hobbies and skill sets.
<br>
<b>Part B:</b> Review all of your social media accounts. With a trusted adult, spend time going through
accounts discussing your posts. If you are embarrassed by this, perhaps some should be deleted!
Any complaints you have made about 'anything or anyone' should be discussed and perhaps deleted
or reworded, as should anything considered provocative, discriminatory or unkind. Ensure that your
photos are also showing what you want the world (and future employers) to see. Check security
features.
For assessment show your Duke leader your CV and a detailed report about the changes
you made to your social media and what you have learned from the process.
