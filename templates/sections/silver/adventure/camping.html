Discuss and agree with an adult whether you will pitch a tent at a campsite or in
the wild. You should do it with as little assistance as possible. If it is a two man
tent you should need NO help. You may have a sibling or parent for company but
they should not do anything for you. Before you go, read up on the Outdoor
Access Code so that you know how to look after our countryside. Sleep all night
in the tent and, without causing any damage to anything (grass included) cook
and eat your dinner outside. Take photos or videos of the event. A trusted adult
should not help but should ensure that you are safe.

For assessment, you will need: your plan, photos of your camp showing your setup, 
photos of the place you camped and ate, as well as photos to show that you
left no trace. You also need a written comment from your trusted adult.
