Instead of throwing away broken items or torn clothes and having to spend money on
new ones, learn to fix them by hand / machine sewing, darning or, if it is something
other than fabric, perhaps by gluing or screwing etc. If a hem has come lose, a button
is missing, a seam is ripped, the cuff of a jumper frayed, a leg has fallen off a stool etc.,
learn to fix it.

For assessment, be able to show your teacher 'before and after' evidence of <b>five</b>
things you have fixed.
