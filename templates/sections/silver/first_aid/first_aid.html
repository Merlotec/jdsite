The aim of this First Aid course is to give you some crucial knowledge in case you ever find yourself in a situation where someone needs your help. 
A huge percentage of teenagers panic and run away from situations.
<br>
You knowing what to do for your friends, family or strangers could be the difference between life and death for them. All you need to do is to keep someone alive until the professionals arrive!
This course is made up of videos and linked questions. It takes about half an hour from start to finish. You may 'save' as you go and come back to it in a second sitting if you would like.
At the end, you will receive an email with your score. You must score more than 80%.
If you don't, you need to resit the course. 
You can do it as many times as you like.
<br>
Once you finish it, you will be emailed your result. If you have scored more than 80%, you should upload the pdf to your Senior Duke portal and notify your teacher that you have completed the First Aid section.

<h4> Important Points </h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        There are different ideas about CPR in different countries. This is the UK's method. It works anywhere in the world. However, you might like to do some further research into how it is done in your country.
    </li>
    <li>
        At the moment, due to Covid, it is suggested that you do chest compressions only for strangers. Rescue breaths help but, if you feel unwilling to do them, keeping going with chest compressions will help your patient.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>ALWAYS TAKE A PHONE WITH YOU WHEN YOU NEED TO USE AN AED </b> (defibrillator) as many of them are locked and you need to call the emergency services to 'release' them.
