If it’s done regularly, it’s not too bad a job! Using appropriate cloths/brushes etc and
cleaning fluid, learn how to clean the bath/shower, scrub the tiles, wash the shower curtain/
screen, pull hair out of the plug hole(!), clean the sink, the taps, the shelves and cupboards,
the toilet (inside, outside and round about) as well as sweeping and mopping the floor and
emptying the bin. Make sure you don’t use the same cloth for the toilet and the sink!
Having learned how to do it once, repeat the process one or two weeks later.
For assessment, show your self assessment and explain what you learned about each step of
the job and how the task went second time around.
