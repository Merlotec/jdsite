On average we walk three to four miles an hour. According to your level of fitness, your aim is to
decide how far you plan to walk twice a week. You could aim to walk the same measured loop each
time and will find, over the month period, you can complete your loop increasingly quickly. 
<br>
Twice a week for 1 MONTH, you must keep an ongoing table of your
exercise including: dates, duration, distances, times, emotions (how you felt before/after/during -
you donâ€™t have to write much). Each time, input your times to a graph to see how you have
succeeded in improving your time and emotion. The map, table and graph is the evidence required
for assessment.
