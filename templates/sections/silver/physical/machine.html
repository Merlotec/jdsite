If you are lucky enough to have access to a rowing machine or some other fitness machine (step/
cross-trainer etc), how quickly can you row 1000m distance or altitude gain?

Twice a week for 1 MONTH, you must keep an ongoing table of your
exercise including: dates, duration, distances, times, emotions (how you felt before/after/during -
you donâ€™t have to write much). Each time, input your times to a graph to see how you have
succeeded in improving your time and emotion. The map, table and graph is the evidence required
for assessment.
